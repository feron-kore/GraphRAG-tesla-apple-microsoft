$175.00

Apple's B/S inv increased Q/Q at the strongest rate in a
decade, reflecting the late Dec iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max ramp
and strategic component pre-purchases. Separately, the App
Store returned as a top 2 Services driver, while Music was a
top 3 Services driver for the first time in 6+ years.
Balance sheet inventory spike reflects late December production ramp and
strategic component purchases. While Apple's vendor non-trade receivables (an
indication of inventory sitting at contract manufacturers) balance fell 7% Q/Q in
the December quarter, B/S inventory spiked 38% sequentially, the strongest Q/Q
B/S inventory growth in the December quarter in a decade (Exhibit 1). We believe
this reflects two dynamics. First, given the late December ramp of iPhone 14
Pro/Pro Max production in Zhengzhou, China, we believe Apple was likely holding
an elevated level of finished goods inventory ending the quarter, which we'd
expect to get worked down in the March quarter. Second, and perhaps more
importantly, we believe Apple was in the market in the December quarter
strategically pre-purchasing commonly used components (i.e. more commoditized
supplies like NAND/DRAM) at favorable prices. In response to a question about
Apple's 43.5-44.5% gross margin guidance on the Dec Q earnings call, CFO Luca
Maestri noted "we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to
be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so, obviously, components are a big
part of that". With NAND and DRAM prices down ~25% over the last 8 months
and ~50% over the last year, we believe commodity costs can remain a
meaningful gross margin tailwind for Apple into F2H23 and likely FY24.
Structurally lower D&A remains gross margins tailwind. D&A as a percentage of
Apple's revenue continues to trend lower than historical levels, which we believe
is a sustainable tailwind to gross margins (barring a notable ramp in capex or
large acquisition). In the December Q, Apple's D&A expense of $2.9B was just
2.5% of revenue, down from a historical average of 3.3% (2013-2021; Exhibit 2),
which we estimate equates to a 10bps Y/Y tailwind to gross margins this quarter
(Exhibit 3). While this is down from an average 110bps Y/Y tailwind to gross
margins in FY22, we expect the gross margin tailwind from lower D&A to lessen

as Apple reaches a more "steady-state" level of D&A expense, Importantly, this
makes Apple's December quarter gross margin performance (43%) and March
quarter gross margin guidance (43.5-44.5%) more impressive in the face of
significant FX headwinds (300 bps Y/Y in the Dec Q, 270 bps Y/Y in the March Q),
a result of 1) positive segment mix shift, 2) strong iPhone pricing (up 8% Y/Y in the
Dec Q), 3) commodity cost tailwinds and supplier price re-negotiations, 4) logistics
becoming a Y/Y tailwind (although prices are still "significantly" above pre-COVID
levels), and 5) Apple's continued efforts to in-source key technology such as
processors, sensors, displays, batteries, and cameras. To this last point, Apple's
R&D expense in the Dec Q reached a near-record of 6.6% of revenue vs. the 3.9%
historical Dec Q average (Exhibit 4) – while this was driven by R&D expense
coming in ~$400M more than we had forecasted, we believe this was also a
result of Apple's depressed Dec Q revenue base.

App Store a top 2 Services revenue driver once again, and Music a top 3 Services
driver for the first time. Apple's 10-Q highlights that the three largest drivers of
Services net sales growth in the Dec Q were: 1) cloud services, 2) the App Store,
and 3) music. Importantly, these disclosures confirm that the App Store did
return to growth in the quarter after 2 quarters of flat Y/Y App Store
performance. We estimate App Store net revenue grew 7% Y/Y in the December
quarter, largely a function of Apple's 14 week quarter, as the App Store would
have declined 1% Y/Y (MSe) if not for the 14th week. We estimate that in January,
the App Store continued its streak of net revenue growth (growing ~1% Y/Y)
after 5 consecutive months of declines last summer/fall (Exhibit 5). Additionally,
Apple Music's inclusion as a top 3 Services driver is notable as the service hasn't
been a top 3 Services driver in 6+ years, which we believe partially reflects the
early impact of the ~10% average price increase put into effect in late October.

Risk Reward – Apple, Inc. (AAPL.O)

Top Pick

Stability and Strength of Ecosystem Underappreciated by Investors
PRICE TARGET $175.00

OVERWEIGHT THESIS

Our $175 PT is sum-of-the-parts driven. We apply a 6.3x EV/Sales multiple on Apple's Product
business (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables) and a 6.7x EV/Sales multiple on Apple's Services
business, in-line with their respective peer groups. We also assign ~$160B of EV to Apple's
Future Products (AR/VR, Autos, etc.), which is driven by $21.5B of revenue and an 7.5x target
EV/Sales multiple. This implies a 25.5x target P/E on FY24 EPS of $6.85.

Apple has the world's most valuable
technology platform with 2.0B active
devices. While Apple is exposed to a
potential slowing of consumer demand, we
believe it is better positioned vs. other
consumer hardware names with its sticky
user base & history of investment through
cycles. Tailwinds to drive a re-rating over the
next year include 1) new product launches
(including rumored AR/VR launch), 2) PC
market share gains on the back of M1 Macs,
3) increasing monetization of high margin
services, and 4) strong cash returns. Longerterm investments in augmented reality,
payments, health, autos and home can help
sustain growth as Apple captures more of
its users' time and wallet share.

iPhone shipments reach all-time record in
FY23. Consumer demand remains resilient,
and stronger than expected iPhone purchase
intentions and mix shift to higher end
iPhone models (and capacity SKUs) drive
strong iPhone shipments. Total revenue
reaches $457B in FY23, while EPS reaches
$7.01. We shift to an lifetime value-based
valuation in our bull case, which gives Apple
credit for the shift towards subscription.
Our $230 bull case valuation implies a 31.6x
target P/E multiple.

Apple sees some impact from weaker
consumer. iPhone replacement cycles
lengthen, Mac declines 20% Y/Y, and
Wearables/iPad decline low single digits, but
low double digit Services growth and iPhone
ASP growth are partial offsets, leading to
FY23 rev -2% Y/Y. Mix towards higher
margin iPhones & Services and lower
FX/inflationary headwinds leads to a mid44% FY23 GM, and $80B of share buybacks
drives EPS of $6.02 for FY23 or $6.85 for
FY24. Apple starts to get credit for its
upcoming AR/VR launch.

iPhone strength fails to materialize in FY23
& consumer weakens more than expected.
Growth slows across the portfolio as
consumer discretionary income is pressured
& WFH tailwinds fade, causing a weaker
than expected year of Product growth.
Weaker consumer demand and FX
headwinds lead Services revenue growth to
decline MSD Y/Y. SOTP based bear case
valuation of $105 implies 17.6x FY24 bear
case EPS of $5.96 (vs. base case EPS of
$6.85).
