Near-term cyclical impacts on Azure create an attractive entry
point into one of the best secular growth stories in tech.
Easing compares, price increases, waning FX headwinds and
decelerating opex all work to accelerate EPS growth to double
digits by Q4, which should bring investors back to MSFT.
Two Steps Needed for the Clearing Event, Q2 Brought an Important One.
Coming out of a disappointing Q1 print, there were two high-level questions
investors wanted resolved before getting back on board with MSFT: 1) where
(and when) does the deceleration in Azure growth stabilize?; and 2) after six
straight years of operating margin expansion, does the company still have the
capability to protect EPS as growth slows? After the Q2 print, the first question
remains unresolved – while Azure growth of 38% YoY constant currency (cc) for
the quarter came in ahead of guidance and investor expectations of 35-36% cc
growth, management's commentary on a weakening of growth trends in
December (to mid-30's cc growth) and a guide for a further 4-5% point
deceleration from those levels in the March quarter (implying 30-31% cc growth)
came in below expectations and, more importantly, failed to show any
moderation in the pace of deceleration. That said, the company did more strongly
argue the near-term impacts (increasing optimization of existing Cloud spend)
were cyclical in nature, there were no changes in competitive dynamics and the
underlying secular trends remain firmly intact. If anything, the faster pace of
development in AI functionality is further expanding the market opportunity
ahead of Azure. Additionally, CEO Satya Nadella did place some bounds on the
duration they expect these optimization impacts to last, noting, "I don't think we're
going to take 2 years to optimize, but we're going to take this year to optimize." On
the second question, the company more clearly laid out the potential for further
leverage at Microsoft – a more moderated expansion in headcount in Q2 (up <1%
QoQ), combined with the restructuring expected to take headcount down by
~10,000 through the course of Q3, puts the company's anticipated opex growth
for Q4 in the low single digits in constant currency. With the management team
guiding to ~6% cc revenue growth in Q3, FX headwinds turning neutral by Q4
based on current rates, compares further easing and Cloud price increases
starting on April 1, we see a clear path to operating margins returning to
expansion in Q4. Our current model forecasts 8.4% YoY revenue growth against

2% YoY total expense growth driving almost 200 bps of operating margin
expansion in Q4 and a return to mid-teens EPS growth. Bottom line, while
investors did not get everything they wanted in the Q2 print, a clear road map
back to mid-teens EPS growth and the solid positioning of Microsoft against the
most compelling secular demand trends in tech (see our note, "Microsoft: 4Q22
CIO Survey Takeaways — Not Immune to the Macro, But Well Positioned for the
Secular", 01/11/23) with the stock trading at 20x our CY24 EPS estimates

What We Liked:
Azure Growth of +38% YoY Beat Guidance and the Buyside Whisper.
Azure growth of +38% YoY in constant currency (cc) beat management's
guidance looking for +37% cc growth and came in ahead of investor
expectations looking for a 1-2pt miss vs. guidance.
Office 365 Commercial Accelerated vs. Last Q and Beat Expectations.
O365 Commercial grew 18% in cc, ahead of the 17% YoY growth in cc from
Q1 and ahead of management's expectations. Strength was balanced
across seats and ARPU, with upgrades to the premium E5 SKU remaining a
durable driver.
Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud (the HighValue Commercial Segments) Beat the Midpoint of Guidance, Even After
Adjusting the Guidance Ranges for a Lower FX Headwind. Productivity
and Business Processes (PBP) revenue of $17.0 billion, +7% YoY / +13% in
cc, came in toward the high end of the updated guidance range looking for
$16.72-$17.02 billion. Intelligent Cloud (IC) revenue of $21.51 billion, +18%
YoY/ +24% in cc, came in toward the high end of the updated guidance
range looking for $21.27-$21.57 billion.
Margins and EPS Beat Consensus in 2Q23. Gross margins of 67.1% slightly
beat MSe/consensus expectations for 66.9%/67.0%, with a more
substantial ~120bps beat to operating margins, at 40.9% vs. MS/consensus
at 39.7%. Opex came in roughly $500 million below the mid-point of the
guidance range, enabling EPS of $2.32 to beat MS/consensus looking for
$2.27 / $2.30, with moderating expense growth offsetting additional
pressures seen in More Personal Computing revenue.

Rightsizing Expenses to Defend Margins. Last quarter, management
guided operating margins down 1pt YoY in USD, which included the $3.7
billion benefit from lower depreciation from the useful life accounting
change. Now management is guiding down 2pts YoY in USD, but this
excludes the accounting change as well as the restructuring change. After
adding in the $3.7B accounting change, when the like-to-like operating
margin guidance on a reported basis actually improves – from down 1%
YoY to roughly flat. This improvement can partially be explained by $300
million less of a negative impact from energy costs, some modest
favorable FX movement since last Q and the recently announced
restructuring being executed on through Q3. The remaining improvement
stems from the recently announced restructuring and spend moderation.
Bottom line, the company is holding the line on margins, even against a
weaker top line.
Areas to Monitor:
Total Revenue Missed Consensus in Q2 and in Q3 Guidance. Weaker-thanexpected growth in Windows Commercial, Devices and Gaming contributed
to More Personal Computing revenues of $14.2 billion (down 19% YoY or 16% cc) coming in $500 million shy of the mid-point of management's $14.5
to $14.9 billion revenue guide and pulled total revenues of $52.7 billion
(+2% YoY or +7% cc) slightly below consensus expectations of $52.9
billion. The company's Q3 guide anticipates the headwinds to More
Personal Computing persist (guided down 17% YoY at the mid-point), along
with further deceleration in Azure, leaving the mid-point of the total
revenue guide at $50.95 billion (+3% YoY or +6% cc) shy of consensus
expectations of $52.5 billion.
Despite Q2 Azure Strength, Azure Decelerated Exiting the Quarter and
Forward Azure Growth Guidance of 30-31% YoY in CC Fell Below
Investor Expectations. Azure growth exited Q2 in the mid-30%'s in
constant currency and management guided to another 4-5% deceleration
from those levels, implying a 7-8% deceleration vs. the 38% in cc from Q1.
We lower our near-term Azure forecasts and now model 27% cc growth in
Q4 and 1H24.
Stepping Away from 20% CC Commercial Revenue Growth. With the
expectation of deteriorating business trends the company saw in December
to continue into Q3, Microsoft noted the 20% constant currency growth it
achieved in 1H23 would decelerate in 2H23, implying they will fall short of
the 20% constant currency commercial revenue growth outlook for FY23.
Microsoft also failed to reiterate its double-digit constant currency
revenue and operating income target for FY23.
More Personal Computing Worse Than Expected, Down 16% YoY in
Constant Currency; Q3 Guidance Implies -17% YoY Reported Growth.
PC Market Continues to Negatively Impact Windows OEM and Devices.
Windows OEM and Devices revenue both declined 39%% YoY, and Q3
commentary suggests Windows OEM down mid-to-high 30%'s and Devices
3

down mid-40%'s.

Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services Disappointed. Weaker
new business moderation impacted Windows Commercial more significantly
than other KPI's given higher mix of upfront revenue recognition under ASC 606
creating more volatility. Revenue growth of -3% reported missed our
expectation for +5% YoY growth.

Lower Revenue and Lower Opex Increases Operating Margins Off a Smaller Top
Line, Mitigating Negative EPS Revision to ~1%. With management detailing more
challenging demand trends from December continuing into Q3, we lower our
revenue estimates 1.4% / 3.2% / 3.4% in FY23/FY24 and FY25. However, following
the shift in investment philosophy and the restructuring, we lower opex by
2%/9.5%/9.7% in our forecast years, leading to stronger operating margins off a
lower revenue base, causing only a 1% decline in EPS forecasts.

Commercial Cloud Growth Decelerates
Significantly. Slower cloud growth drags on
PBP and IC segment growth; MPC declines
from current levels. Total revenue grows in

The equity research analysts or strategists principally responsible for the preparation of Morgan Stanley Research have received compensation based upon
various factors, including quality of research, investor client feedback, stock picking, competitive factors, firm revenues and overall investment banking

Stanley or the profitability or revenues of particular trading desks.
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates do business that relates to companies/instruments covered in Morgan Stanley Research, including market making, providing
liquidity, fund management, commercial banking, extension of credit, investment services and investment banking. Morgan Stanley sells to and buys from
customers the securities/instruments of companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research on a principal basis. Morgan Stanley may have a position in the debt
of the Company or instruments discussed in this report. Morgan Stanley trades or may trade as principal in the debt securities (or in related derivatives) that

Certain disclosures listed above are also for compliance with applicable regulations in non-US jurisdictions.

STOCK RATINGS
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan
Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of
buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research
contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the
contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a
stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

Global Stock Ratings Distribution
(as of December 31, 2022)
The Stock Ratings described below apply to Morgan Stanley's Fundamental Equity Research and do not apply to Debt Research produced by the Firm.
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with FINRA requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside our ratings of
Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight,
Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative weightings (see definitions below).
To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and
Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
